After that, you may now communicate with your AIChat assistant, who can retrieve info from your documents. You can choose from the following AIGC providers:
```python
res = aichat.Chat.openai("Introduce yourself.")

```
Response example:
```json5
{
  'errno': 0, 
  'data': {'response': 'I am your personal AI assistant. I can help you with anything you need.'}, 
  'msg': 'success'
}
